Repo for TOP - Project: Recipes

A simple web page containing some of my favorite recipes. The project is an assignment from The Odin Project.
By creating this project, I got accustomed to creating a HTML Boilerplate, adding images to html files, 
referencing one html file from another one and using lists.
